## Slice D / T1 todo-expo fixture

Expo SDK 58 (expo ~58.0.19, RN 0.88.0). Docs checked 2026-11-02: https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/imagepicker/ and https://docs.expo.dev/develop/user-interface/app-icons/

**Decisions**
- Generated with `create-expo-app@latest -t blank-typescript --no-agents-md --no-install`; it is inside an existing git repo so it ran no `git init`. Deps via `npx expo install` (image-picker, async-storage).
- Persistence is AsyncStorage; photo is stored as a URI only (fixture, not a production-grade copy to document dir).
- Plugin config: `photosPermission` with a specific string, `cameraPermission: false`, `microphonePermission: false` (doc: false blocks CAMERA / RECORD_AUDIO on Android). App only calls `launchImageLibraryAsync`.
- Template `assets/icon.png` is already 1024x1024, colour type 2, no tRNS: kept as is. Adaptive foreground/background 512x512, monochrome 432x432 (all RGBA, fine): docs say at least 512 and background must match foreground dims; no exact adaptive size is stated.
- Deleted the template `LICENSE` (Expo copyright, MIT); todo-vite has none and the repo has its own.

**Rejected**
- Replacing template icons: they already meet the docs. Camera permission left on: app does not use it.
- `.gitleaksignore` entry: not needed; the lockfile has zero `deprecated` notices, grep for emails and home paths is empty, `privacy-scan --staged` rc=0.

**Assumptions**
- `splash-icon.png` (indexed, tRNS) is not referenced by app.json, so the alpha rule does not apply; recheck if a splash plugin is added.
- Doc text was read from rendered HTML via curl; adaptive-icon sizes beyond the quoted lines may exist in Android guidelines.

**Deferred**
- No device or simulator run; only `expo export --platform ios` bundling. No EAS config by design.

**Touches**
- fixtures repo: `todo-expo/` (new), root `README.md` (one bullet). No shared config; `.gitleaksignore` unchanged.
